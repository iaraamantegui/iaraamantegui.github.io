        <!-- Blue Vanda -->
        <div class="item">
            <h3>Blue Vanda (Vanda Coerulea)</h3>
            <p><strong>About This Orchid:</strong> The Blue Vanda (Vanda coerulea) is a medium to large-sized orchid that produces large, long-lasting, pale violet-blue to purple-blue flowers with darker purple tessellations. Native to China and India, it is found on tree trunks in open woodland at elevations between 3,300 and 5,300 feet. This cool to intermediate growing orchid blooms in the fall.</p>

            <p><strong>Why You Will Love It:</strong> Vanda coerulea is highly sought after because it produces blue flowers, a color that is uncommon among orchids. It has been used in the breeding of many Vanda hybrids. The Blue Vanda has medicinal properties as well. In India, the flowers are used to treat chest conditions. Juice from the leaves is used to treat diarrhea, dysentery, and skin conditions.</p>

            <p><strong>Care Tips:</strong> Provide almost full sun with some partial shade, especially in the summer. Ensure there is good ventilation and that the leaves are a medium green color. Dark green leaves indicate the plant is not getting enough light. Optimum temperatures are as follows:</p>

<div class="care-tips">
    <p><strong>Spring:</strong> 60-62°F at night and 80-84°F during the day.</p>
    <p><strong>Summer:</strong> 64°F at night and 75-77°F during the day.</p>
    <p><strong>Winter:</strong> 44-46°F at night and 71-75°F during the day.</p>
</div>

<p>This orchid needs high humidity, between 80% and 85% in summer and fall, and 50% to 55% in winter and spring. To create humidity, set the plant on a tray of gravel that is partially filled with water. Water heavily during active growth periods to keep the roots constantly moist. Reduce watering in the fall and water sparingly during the winter.</p>

<p>To ensure your Blue Vanda blooms at least once a year, move it to a location with more light and sun if it isn't flowering.</p>

        <!-- The White Nun -->
        <div class="item">
            <h3>The White Nun (Lycaste Virginalis)</h3>
            <p><strong>About This Orchid:</strong>Lycaste virginalis, also known as the White Nun Orchid or Monja Blanca, is revered for its elegant, snowy white flowers Native to cloud forests in Mexico, Guatemala, and Honduras, this orchid produces large, waxy flowers that can last several weeks. It is the national flower of Guatemal.</p>

            <p><strong>Why You Will Love It:</strong>This orchid is a symbol of peace and national pride in Guatemala. It is also an example of successful conservation efforts. In the late 1800s, thousands of White Nun Orchids were taken from Guatemala and exported, most of which died. By the 1930s, Lycaste virginalis was considered rare. Poaching continued even after collection of the orchid was prohibited in the 1940s, leading the Guatemalan government to ban all orchid exports until the 1990s. Today, it is protected under Guatemalan law.</p>

            <p><strong>Care Tips:</strong> The White Nun Orchid prefers intermediate to cool conditions and indirect light. Keep humidity levels between 60% and 80% and use a well-draining medium, like bark mixed with sphagnum moss. This orchid is semi-deciduous, meaning it loses some leaves seasonally, so it's important to reduce watering in the winter.</p>

        <!-- The Queen of the Night -->
        <div class="item">
            <h3>The Queen of the Night (Madelaine's Angraecum)</h3>
            <p><strong>About This Orchid:</strong>Madelaine's Angraecum (Angraecum magdalenae) is a Madagascan orchid with large white flowers and a spicy, jasmine fragrance that is stronger at night. This lithophytic orchid grows on boulders in areas with nutritious leaf litter. It is often referred to as the "Queen of the Angraecums".</p>

            <p><strong>Why You Will Love It:</strong>Its large, 3-4 inch flowers can last 4-6 weeks. It boasts a romantic backstory. Although a French naturalist named H. Perrier is credited with discovering the orchid, he noted it should be called Madelaine's Angraecum, after Madelaine Drouhard, the woman who actually discovered and cultivated the plant. Two years later, Perrier and Drouhard married.</p>

            <p><strong>Care Tips:</strong> Madelaine's Angraecum grows in an intermediate to cool climate at altitudes between 5,600 and 6,550 feet. It thrives in very bright, but slightly shaded light in warmer months and direct sunlight during the winter. The average high temperature in its natural habitat is 75 degrees Fahrenheit, while winter highs average 68 degrees Fahrenheit and lows average 45 degrees Fahrenheit. You can mimic this environment by planting Madelaine's Angraecum in a clay pot. Clay pots slowly leech water, which keeps both the pot and the root system cool.</p>

            <button class="faq-question" onclick="toggleAnswer(0)">What are some distinctive features of orchids?</button>
            <div class="faq-answer" id="answer-0">
                <p>Orchids are renowned for their extraordinary diversity, encompassing over 28,000 species found worldwide, excluding Antarctica. Their habitats range from lush tropical rainforests to temperate regions, with many thriving as epiphytes, attaching themselves to trees. Orchid flowers are characterized by their symmetry and intricate designs, featuring three petals and three sepals, with one petal modified into a prominent lip called the labellum. This labellum is often uniquely adapted to attract specific pollinators. Orchids employ fascinating pollination strategies, including mimicking the appearance, scent, and color of female insects to lure males for pollination, a phenomenon known as "sexual deception."</p>

            <div class="faq-answer" id="answer-1">
                <p>Angraecum magdalenae, also known as the "Comet Orchid" or Madelaine's Angreacum, is a captivating orchid species native to the highlands of Madagascar. Its pure white, star-shaped flowers are adorned with long, elegant spurs, giving them a dramatic and ethereal appearance. Notably, the Angraecum magdalenae releases a sweet, intoxicating fragrance at night to attract its specific pollinator, a long-tongued hawk moth. This co-evolutionary relationship between the orchid and the moth inspired Darwin's hypothesis about specialized pollination.</p>

            <div class="faq-answer" id="answer-2">
                <p>Cultivating Angraecum magdalenae can be challenging, requiring intermediate to cool temperatures, bright but indirect light, and a high-humidity environment with good air circulation. To prevent waterlogging, well-draining potting media, such as bark and perlite, are essential. Mimicking its natural mountain habitat by providing slightly cooler temperatures at night can be beneficial. Due to its sensitivity to root disturbance, repotting should only be done when necessary. Though demanding, successfully growing and blooming the "Queen of the Angraecums" is a rewarding accomplishment for dedicated orchid enthusiasts.</p>

            <div class="faq-answer" id="answer-3">
                <p>The Lycaste virginalis, or "White Nun Orchid," is the national flower of Guatemala. Its pristine white flowers with a delicate blush of yellow or pink at the lip symbolize beauty and peace, leading to its local name, "Monja Blanca," meaning White Nun. Sadly, this iconic orchid faces threats from habitat destruction and over-collection. Thankfully, conservation efforts are underway to protect this national treasure.</p>

            <button class="faq-question" onclick="toggleAnswer(4)">What are the optimal growing conditions for Lycaste virginalis?</button>
            <div class="faq-answer" id="answer-4">
                <p>Lycaste virginalis thrives in intermediate to cool conditions with indirect light, similar to its natural cloud forest habitat. Maintaining humidity levels between 60-80% is crucial, and using a well-draining medium, such as a blend of bark and sphagnum moss, promotes airflow around the roots. Being semi-deciduous, it may shed some leaves seasonally, prompting a reduction in watering during its dormancy period. While reducing watering in winter, regular misting helps maintain plant health without risking root rot.</p>
